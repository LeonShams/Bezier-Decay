# Info
---
**Bezier-Decay is a package for quickly creating and implementing complex decay curves.** This package can easily be implemented into any existing code that is using python 3.6 or newer and is very lightweight since it is based on complex mathematical equation rather than loops. There are domain restrictions because of this so not all curves will work, but most should work fine and will run quickly even on slower machines.

# Installation
---
Copy and paste the following command into the shell
```pip install --upgrade git+https://github.com/schaall/snake.git```
